# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 10th May 2019

**Background:** I failed this quest back in 2017, but I am determined to finish it this time. The main cause of failure was the lack of focus and numerous distractions from new and exciting technologies. 

I believe such failures are crucial to both my personal and career development despite the pain and costs. Given new understanding about my own strengths and weaknesses, I structure this new quest to focus only a single language and domain. 

Finally, I will acknowledge even the time spent on installing software, since it's often much longer than coding time. It's unproductive, but still part of the learning experience and should be documented.

I must learn to document more quickly and efficiently, but must count such time into this quest to prevent burn-outs and self-blame. 

**Goals:**
Reach intermediate - advanced level of scientific computing using C++

**Priority:**
1. Implement sensitivity analysis libraries for parameters in C++ with minimal dependency
2. Explore & contribute to [Shogun ML](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun/tree/shogun_6.1.3) 
3. Master common algorithms in C++
